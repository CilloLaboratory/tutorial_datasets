# Tutorial datasets
This is a repository for holding useful tutorial datasets to accompany the Dry Lab Manual.

# 10X Genomics 3' healthy donor PBMC
The HD_PBMC_3prime data directory contains 4 healthy donor PBMC datasets and a tsv containing associated metadata. 
These data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus from accession number [GSE139324](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE139324).

The purpose of these files is simply to have some data for testing workflows.

# 10X Genomics 3' and 5' healthy donor PBMC
The PBMC_integration_datasets directory contains HD_PBMC_1 and HD_PBMC_2 from the HD_PBMC_3prime data directory, but also contains two in-house healthy donor PBMC datasets generated using 10X Genomics 5' chemistry. Also included is a txt file containing metadata for these samples. 

The purpose of these files is to have a toy dataset with known batch effects to test integration workflows.
